## ‚û°Ô∏è How It Works (Real-World Example)

The system manages the entire customer and order lifecycle. For instance, when a customer like **Sophia** places an order:

1.  A new **HandsMen Customer** record is created, ensuring correct email format.
2.  A **HandsMen Order** is placed for specific products (e.g., T-shirts), with the **Total Amount** automatically calculated.
3.  Upon 'Confirmation,' an **Automated Order Confirmation Flow** triggers, sending an email to Sophia and reducing **Inventory** stock.
4.  If stock drops below a threshold, a **Low Stock Alert Flow** notifies the company owner via email.
5.  A daily **Loyalty Program Flow** updates Sophia's loyalty status (e.g., 'Silver') based on purchases and sends a corresponding email.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

We envision expanding the functionality of HandsMen Threads CRM with:

* **Chatbot Integration:** Implementing an Einstein Bot for instant customer support.
* **Advanced Analytics & AI:** Leveraging Einstein Analytics for predictive insights into sales trends and customer behavior.
* **Mobile App Development:** Providing a custom mobile app for field representatives.
